With one hiccup where I got one bad box of rocks out of 15 and we had an issue with a bunch of them cracking and  popping when we first heated it... I made mention to their team (which were easy to get on the phone multiple times), and they quickly sent out a fresh set of new rocks.  You can't have everything of this size always end up perfectly, or very rarely, but when issues do arise, you want to have aligned with a professional and quick responding outfit like Salus.  Hats off to their entire team over there! 10/10",
